# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

-   **Vite**: A next-generation front-end tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   **shadcn/ui**: A collection of re-usable components that can be copied and pasted into your apps.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
-   **React Router**: For declarative routing in React applications.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and a package manager (like npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Portfolio
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
-   `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
-   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to any static site hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. The `npm run build` command will generate a `dist` directory with all the static assets ready for deployment.
